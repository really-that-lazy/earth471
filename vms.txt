Massive Sulfide deposits

sea floor black smokers increase in size until collapsing under own weight
in rock record this appears as a breccia

formation of black smokers
>seawater migrates downwards into fractures, heated rapidly and explode back up

white smokers are initial stage of black smokers

at high temperature point of journey, fluids can easily pick up copper, then
drop it when cooling down as approaching cold seawater above

to lesser extent gold can be transmitted by same process,

black smokers known to extebd back to the archaean


important aspect of vms deposits is that they occur in a extensional tectonic
setting

many are formed, but most are lost to subduction

important aspect of vms deposits is that they occur in a extensional tectonic
setting

many are formed, but most are lost to subduction

those that are preserved must be deformed

New Brunswick vms deposits more commonly in lower paleozoic, whereas majority
of deposits are archaean


important > most abundant ore minerals on chart

vms only not mined on antarctica

polymetallic deposits are lower risk because diversification of commodities,
but still wont svae you when the market goes down


textures of VMS:
-expelled mineral fragments settle into a widely spread out apron around the vent
(saw this on the sample passed around as layering)


open at depth > means we know the deposit continues downwards, we just dont
know how far it extends down
