Sudbury Igneous Complex - layer affected by the asteroid strike, messed up
seds & other preexisting rocks, all melted

after the strike, cooling, some pockets of sulfide cooled out first and sank
to bottom to cool, sometimes seeping into fractures in layer below, caused
by the impact. Sulfides sucked out the copper, nickel, etc. from the
surroundings and concentrated them
